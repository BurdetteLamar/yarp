## Discussions

The discussions page on the GitHub repository are open. If you have a question or want to discuss the project, feel free to open a new discussion or comment on an existing one. This is the best place to ask questions about the project.

## Code

Once you have a discussion going, you can open a pull request with your changes. We will review your code and get it merged in.

## Tests

We could always use more tests! One of the biggest challenges of this project is building up a big test suite. If you want to contribute tests, feel free to open a pull request. These will get merged in as soon as possible.

## Documentation

We could always use more documentation! If you want to contribute documentation, feel free to open a pull request. These will get merged in as soon as possible. Documenting functions or methods is always useful, but we also need more guides and tutorials. If you have an idea for a guide or tutorial, feel free to open an issue and we can discuss it.
